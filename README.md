# AutoVault

I have developed a desktop application in Java using the Swing library, which enables users to manage a garage of vehicles. The application employs key OOP principles, including inheritance and abstraction, as well as encapsulation to ensure data security.

The program allows users to add new cars to the garage by providing information such as the license plate, model, brand, type of transmission, and fuel type. Users can then select the desired vehicle from a dropdown menu (Combobox) and update the car's parameters or delete it entirely using the license plate as a unique identifier.

By implementing these features, the application enhances the user's ability to manage their garage of vehicles in a user-friendly manner, while ensuring the security of their data.
